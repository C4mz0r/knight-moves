# knight-moves

The challenge here is to choose any two coordinates, A and B, on a chessboard and find and print the shortest path that a knight can take to get from A to B.

The chessboard is represented by 8 rows and 8 columns, zero based.  So for example, coordinate [1,3] would refer to the 2nd row and the 4th column.
